> I'll explain each level in it's part completely

**But about generall features of software:**

when you run the software:(this part is not complete yet)

* You will see 5 Icons for 5 different levels that only first level is unlocked.
* When user finished first level the second level will be unlocked and respectively each higher level will be unlocked after finishing each lower level.
* After finishing each level that level will be locked. But after finishing all levels, entire levels will be locked.
* Software will continue the game from the start point of where the player had left.
* Software will notify to play each day.(??????)
> Questions arised in designing these features of the game.(write each question arises while designing the application, NOT COMPLETE)
>1. How I can choose an option by clicking on it?
>2. Application must have a realy small size, but how?
>3. How lock and Unlock the levels?
>4. How will the game continue from the start of the part which it was closed last time?
>5. How will the game notify to play every day?(????????)

### Menue:(not complete)

### Gestalt Level:(not comlete)

In this level user drag different parts of the face and drop them in correct part of face

for this level I just tore apart the original image.


faces are in 3 different emotions happy, sad and angry.
**I'll upload code sources after their finished**
> Questions That arises:
>1. How I organize pieces to be chosen?
>2. How I determine that each piece of puzzle is located in correct place?
>3. How does the game go to the next face when the previous one is solved?

## Procedure
### Designing Menue:
### Designing Gestalt Level:(notcomplete)
   * I made faces graphically ready:
    I've needed faces with same size so I cropped them in photoshop.

   * I needed faces to be without components so again I used photoshop to make the face ready.

   * In Gestalt scene I have a main camera , in main camera I haveGame objects which are images(background and frames for faces and their components) and so have spiriterenderer. I have another Gameobject face which has a variable spiriterenderer (faces images) and this gameobject itself has gameobjects g1, g2 and g3 which have spiriterenderers which change in each iteration of the game.
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26525766/138126112-51e2609d-f5f0-4e10-98d3-455e23e8bb00.png)
   
   *  I wrote **"make_face.cs"** to check if the components are located in true place or not? and to change the face when it's finished. This code is attached to gameobject face.


    ```C#
    using System.Collections;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using UnityEngine;

    public class make_face : MonoBehaviour
    {
       public int sprite_count; // this variable changes the number of sprite
       public GameObject eye_l; // this is the left eye game object (Base class for all entities in Unity Scenes.)
       public GameObject eye_r; // this is the right eye game object
       public GameObject mouth; // this is the mouth game object
       public Transform tr_1; //Every object in a Scene has a Transform. It's used to store and manipulate the position,
       
       //rotation and scale of the object.
       public Transform tr_2;
       public Transform tr_3;
       public Vector3 v; //a vector3 variable is Representation of 3D vectors and points.
       
       // This structure is used throughout Unity to pass 3D positions 
       
       // and directions around. It also contains functions for doing common vector operations.
       public Vector3 v1;
       public SpriteRenderer spriteRenderer; //Renders a Sprite for 2D graphics.
       public Sprite[] spriteArray; //Represents a Sprite object for use in 2D gameplay.
       
       // Sprites are 2D graphic objects used for characters, props, projectiles and other elments of 2D gameplay. 
       
       // The graphics are obtained from bitmap images - Texture2D. 
       
       // The Sprite class primarily identifies the section of the image that should be used for a specific sprite. 
       
       // This information can then be used by a SpriteRenderer 
       
       // component on a GameObject to actually display the graphic.
       
       // Start is called before the first frame update
       void Start() // this function will be run just in the beginning of the executation of the game.
       {
           sprite_count = 0; //it assigns 0 to the sprite counter at the beginning.
           tr_2 = eye_r.transform; // it assigns the transform variable tr_2 the transform of gameobject eye_r
           tr_3 = mouth.transform; // it assigns the transform variable tr_3 the transform of gameobject mouth
           v = new Vector3(1.5f, -1, 0.5497855f); //it assigns a variable vector3 v an 3d vector by definning it with
           
           //new Vector3(x value,y value,z value)
           v1= new Vector3(2, -2, 0.5497855f);
           spriteRenderer = gameObject.GetComponent<SpriteRenderer>(); //it assigns variable spriteRenderer the component SpriteRenderer of gameobject that this
           
           //script is attatched to it
           spriteRenderer.sprite = spriteArray[sprite_count];// it assigns the sprite of spriteRenderer one of the sprites in the spriteArray that its number
           
           //is equal to sprite_count

        }
     
        // Update is called once per frame
        void Update()//I'll change this part later
        {

            tr_1 = eye_l.transform;
            print(eye_l.transform.localPosition);
            if (tr_1.localPosition.x > v.x && tr_1.localPosition.x < v1.x && tr_1.localPosition.y < v.y && tr_1.localPosition.y > v1.y)
            {
                sprite_count += 1;
                print("yes");
                spriteRenderer.sprite = spriteArray[sprite_count];

            }
      
        }
  }
    ```
   * I wrote **"draganddrop.cs "** to drag components. So this code is attached to gameobjects g1, g2 and g3. I need to define a box collider 2D for each gameobject g1, g2 and g3 unless the code won't work correctly.

   ```C#
  using System.Collections;
  using System.Collections.Generic;
  using UnityEngine;

  public class draganddrop : MonoBehaviour
  {
    private bool isDragging;// this boolean variable is true when the mouse is down and is false when the mouse is up
    public void OnMouseDown() //this  function will be called when the mouse is down
    {
        isDragging = true;
     }
    public void OnMouseUp() //this  function will be called when the mouse is up
    {
        isDragging = false;
     }

     // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
     if(isDragging)//when the mouse is down
        {
            Vector2 mousePosition = Camera.main.ScreenToWorldPoint(Input.mousePosition) - transform.position;
            // "Input.mousePosition" reports the position of the mouse even when it is not inside the Game View.
            
            //Input.mousePosition is a Vector3 for compatibility with functions that have Vector3 arguments. 
            
            //The z component of the Vector3 is always 0.
            
            //Returns Vector3 The worldspace point created by converting the screen space point at the provided 
            
            //distance z from the camera plane.
            
            //Transforms a point from screen space into world space, where world space is defined as the coordinate system at
            
            //the very top of your game's hierarchy. World space coordinates can still be calculated even when provided as an 
            
            //off-screen coordinate, for example for instantiating an off-screen object near a specific corner of the screen. Screenspace
            
            //is defined in pixels. The bottom-left of the screen is (0,0); the right-top is (pixelWidth,pixelHeight). 
            
            //The z position is in world units from the camera.
            
             // " transform.position" The world space position of the Transform. The position property of a GameObject’s Transform, 
             
             //which is accessible in the Unity Editor and through scripts. Alter this value to move a GameObject. Get this value to 
             
             //locate the GameObject in 3D world space.It is a vector3.

            transform.Translate(mousePosition);
            
            //Moves the transform in the direction and distance of translation.
        }
     }
   }
